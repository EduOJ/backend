# Code style.

All code must be formatted by go fmt.

All tests of app/controllers is running with the same in-memory
database, so they shouldn't rely on a clean database and shouldn't
cleanup after runs. Also, they should be running under parallel mode.

All other tests should make it own database and clean it up after
running.
